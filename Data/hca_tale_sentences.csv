Thumbelina,"then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold.",64,191,0.33507853403141363
Thumbelina,"near the wood in which she had been living lay a corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground.",65,191,0.3403141361256545
Thumbelina,it was to her like struggling through a large wood.,66,191,0.34554973821989526
Thumbelina,oh!,67,191,0.3507853403141361
Thumbelina,how she shivered with the cold.,68,191,0.35602094240837695
Thumbelina,"she came at last to the door of a field- mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble.",69,191,0.3612565445026178
Thumbelina,"there dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room.",70,191,0.36649214659685864
Thumbelina,"poor little tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar- girl, and begged for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.",71,191,0.3717277486910995
Thumbelina,"""you poor little creature,"" said the field-mouse, who was really a good old field-mouse, ""come into my warm room and dine with me.""",72,191,0.3769633507853403

Thumbelina,"and tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.",74,191,0.387434554973822
Thumbelina,"""we shall have a visitor soon,"" said the field-mouse one day; ""my neighbor pays me a visit once a week.",75,191,0.39267015706806285
Thumbelina,"he is better off than i am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet coat.",76,191,0.39790575916230364
Thumbelina,"if you could only have him for a husband, you would be well provided for indeed.",77,191,0.4031413612565445
Thumbelina,"but he is blind, so you must tell him some of your prettiest stories.""",78,191,0.4083769633507853
Thumbelina,"but tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor, for he was a mole.",79,191,0.41361256544502617
Thumbelina,"however, he came and paid his visit dressed in his black velvet coat.",80,191,0.418848167539267
Thumbelina,"""he is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty times larger than mine,"" said the field-mouse.",81,191,0.42408376963350786
Thumbelina,"he was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke slightingly of the sun and the pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.",82,191,0.4293193717277487
Thumbelina,"tiny was obliged to sing to him, ""lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home,"" and many other pretty songs.",83,191,0.43455497382198954
Thumbelina,"and the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very cautious.",84,191,0.4397905759162304
Thumbelina,"a short time before, the mole had dug a long passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling of the field-mouse to his own, and here she had permission to walk with tiny whenever she liked.",85,191,0.44502617801047123
Thumbelina,but he warned them not to be alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage.,86,191,0.450261780104712
Thumbelina,"it was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his passage.",87,191,0.45549738219895286
Thumbelina,"the mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth, and it glittered like fire in the dark; then he went before them to light them through the long, dark passage.",88,191,0.4607329842931937
Thumbelina,"when they came to the spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling, the earth gave way, so that there was a large hole, and the daylight shone into the passage.",89,191,0.46596858638743455
Thumbelina,"in the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.",90,191,0.4712041884816754
Thumbelina,"it made little tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.",91,191,0.47643979057591623
Thumbelina,"but the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs, and said, ""he will sing no more now.",92,191,0.4816753926701571
Thumbelina,how miserable it must be to be born a little bird!,93,191,0.4869109947643979

Thumbelina,"exclaimed the field-mouse, ""what is the use of his twittering, for when winter comes he must either starve or be frozen to death.",96,191,0.5026178010471204
Thumbelina,"still birds are very high bred.""",97,191,0.5078534031413613
Thumbelina,"tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned their backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the soft feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed eyelids.",98,191,0.5130890052356021
Thumbelina,"""perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer,"" she said; ""and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird.""",99,191,0.518324607329843
Thumbelina,"the mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone, and then accompanied the lady home.",100,191,0.5235602094240838
Thumbelina,"but during the night tiny could not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful carpet of hay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and spread it over him; with some down from the flowers which she had found in the field-mouse's room.",101,191,0.5287958115183246
Thumbelina,"it was as soft as wool, and she spread some of it on each side of the bird, so that he might lie warmly in the cold earth.",102,191,0.5340314136125655
Thumbelina,"""farewell, you pretty little bird,"" said she, ""farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us.""",103,191,0.5392670157068062
Thumbelina,"then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went ""thump, thump.""",104,191,0.5445026178010471
Thumbelina,"it was the bird's heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him to life.",105,191,0.5497382198952879
Thumbelina,"in autumn, all the swallows fly away into warm countries, but if one happens to linger, the cold seizes it, it becomes frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remains where it fell, and the cold snow covers it.",106,191,0.5549738219895288
Thumbelina,"tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,– she was only an inch high.",107,191,0.5602094240837696
Thumbelina,"but she took courage, laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a leaf which she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the head of the poor bird.",108,191,0.5654450261780105
Thumbelina,the next morning she again stole out to see him.,109,191,0.5706806282722513
Thumbelina,"he was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern.",110,191,0.5759162303664922
Thumbelina,"""thank you, pretty little maiden,"" said the sick swallow; ""i have been so nicely warmed, that i shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine.""",111,191,0.581151832460733

Thumbelina,"every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again.",139,191,0.7277486910994765

Thumbelina,"then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them.",183,191,0.9581151832460733

Thumbelina,"then there was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again.",185,191,0.9685863874345549
